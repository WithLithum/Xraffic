# Traffic Policer
Traffic Policer is a plugin for LSPDFR by Albo1125 with over one million downloads on lspdfr.com. Originally released in 2015, this is the second plugin for LSPDFR I wrote.

## Code & building
Quite simple, clone the repo, place the below dependencies into the `References` folder, and restore the NuGet packages. It should then build without issue.

This project sprung into life just after I'd started learning C# and it originally started off as just a bit of toying around with ambient events.
Quite a lot of old code and...cough...old bad practice remains today.

If you feel like it, please feel free to contribute by submitting a Pull Request. 
They may make it into a release and, of course, you'll be credited appropriately.
Obviously, feel free to use this as a resource to learn from and improve your programming skills for RPH (credits appreciated, please see licence also if copying/using larger parts of the code).
